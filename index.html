                        <strong>Steve Jobs'</strong> vision of a "computer for the
                        rest of us" sparked the PC revolution and made Apple an icon
                        of American business.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Steven Paul Jobs</strong> was an American inventor,
                        designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief
                        executive and chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's
                        revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and
                        iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern
                        technology. Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin
                        graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was
                        smart but directionless, dropping out of college and
                        experimenting with different pursuits before co-founding
                        Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in
                        1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to
                        Apple more than a decade later. Jobs died in 2011 following
                        a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
